# Railway Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

## Pre-Deployment ‚úì

- [x] Virtual environment created and dependencies installed
- [x] Flask web application created (`web_app.py`)
- [x] Original CLI script refactored for API usage (`concat_videos.py`)
- [x] Complete requirements.txt with all dependencies
- [x] Railway configuration files created
- [x] Web interface with modern UI implemented
- [x] REST API endpoints functional
- [x] Background job processing implemented
- [x] File cleanup and memory management added
- [x] Error handling and validation implemented

## Required Files ‚úì

- [x] `web_app.py` - Main Flask application
- [x] `concat_videos.py` - Core video processing module
- [x] `requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies
- [x] `Procfile` - Railway process configuration
- [x] `nixpacks.toml` - System dependencies (ffmpeg)
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway deployment settings
- [x] `.gitignore` - Version control exclusions
- [x] `README.md` - Updated documentation
- [x] `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide

## Railway Setup Steps

### 1. Repository Setup

- [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
- [ ] Ensure all files are committed

### 2. Railway Account

- [ ] Create account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Connect GitHub account

### 3. Project Deployment

- [ ] Click "New Project" in Railway
- [ ] Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- [ ] Choose your repository
- [ ] Railway auto-detects configuration

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Check build logs for errors
- [ ] Test web interface at Railway URL
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Verify ffmpeg installation in logs

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Web Interface

- [ ] Visit Railway-provided URL
- [ ] Test video URL form submission
- [ ] Verify real-time status updates
- [ ] Test file download functionality

### API Testing

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test concatenation API
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/concatenate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls": ["https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/SampleVideo_1280x720_1mb.mp4", "https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/SampleVideo_1280x720_2mb.mp4"]}'
```

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

- Build completes without errors
- Web interface loads and accepts URLs
- API returns job IDs for valid requests
- Status endpoint shows processing progress
- Download endpoint serves completed videos
- Health check returns `{"status": "healthy"}`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

- **Build fails**: Check `requirements.txt` and `nixpacks.toml`
- **ffmpeg not found**: Verify `nixpacks.toml` configuration
- **App won't start**: Check `Procfile` and `web_app.py`
- **API errors**: Check Railway logs for Python errors

## Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

- [ ] Monitor CPU and memory usage
- [ ] Check application logs
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Configure environment variables if needed

### Endpoints to Monitor

- `GET /health` - Application health
- `GET /` - Web interface availability
- `POST /api/concatenate` - Core functionality

## Optimization

- [ ] Configure Railway sleep mode for development
- [ ] Monitor bandwidth usage
- [ ] Set up log retention
- [ ] Consider auto-scaling for production

## URLs After Deployment

- **Web Interface**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/`
- **API Base**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/health`
